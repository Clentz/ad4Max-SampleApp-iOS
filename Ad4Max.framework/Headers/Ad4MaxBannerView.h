/**
 
 The Ad4MaxBannerView class provides a view that displays banner advertisements to the user using adOne advertisement network. When the user taps a banner view, the view triggers an action programmed into the advertisement.
 
 The Ad4MaxBannerViewâ€™s delegate is called when a banner view cycles to show a new advertisement as well as when the user interacts with the banner view.
 
 A banner view size must be always match the size of the advertisement defined
    in the server, otherwise your delegate will be notified of an error via
    the bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:.
 
 ### Subclassing Notes
 
 The Ad4MaxBannerView class provides a self-contained view. Your application should not subclass ADBannerView nor add subviews to a banner view.
