 The Ad4MaxBannerViewDelegate protocol is implemented by an object to configure an Ad4MaxBannerView and to react to changes in an Ad4MaxBannerView object. The banner view calls its delegate before loading a new banner view, when a new advertisement is loaded, when the user interacts with an advertisement, and when errors occur.

 The returned value can vary at run time and you could decide to return different AD BOX ids for the same banner view. This is typically the case if your application supports the landscape orientation, as an AD BOX is associated to a single Ad format.

 This delegate method is mandatory otherwise you will get an error through your delegate method bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:.

 You have to provide a standard CLLocation object and use in your application a CLLocationManager to update it. You don't need to notify the banner view when an update to the user location is available, this method will be called each time a new Ad will be loaded. 
 
 Notice that you should not request the user location only to target Ads as your application might be rejected by Apple (see ยง4.4 in App Store Review Guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html)

 This method is called when the user clicks the banner view. To allow the action to be triggered, return YES. To suppress the action, return NO. Your application should almost always allow actions to be triggered; preventing actions may alter the Ads your application sees and reduce the revenue your application earns.
 
 If the willLeave parameter is YES, then your application is moved to the background shortly after this method returns. This is the only possible value as of today, NO parameter will not be used.
